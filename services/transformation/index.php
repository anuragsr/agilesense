      <h3>
        We use a <b>proven Agile transformation</b> framework (developed by ourselves) that gets <b>adapted for each company</b> to fit their <b>unique circumstances</b>

            <p>
              In todayâ€™s highly competitive market every company
              tries to outperform, outshine and beat the competitors 
              to bring their awesome products first in the market. 
              Larger corporations cannot bargain on having big client 
              bases anymore. Smaller, more nimble and exciting Agile 
              companies are riding the waves of change, and they are 
              getting a lot of attention ... <b><i>from your client base!</i></b>
            </p>
            <p>
              One needs to work hard to get to the top and even 
              harder to stay there.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>"But, we are also doing Agile!"</b>, you might say. 
              The fact is, almost everybody is <b>"doing"</b> it. 
              That is, focusing on certain Agile practices 
              and working in some kind of iterative environment, 
              but without really adopting the heart of Agile.

              <b>It is not a matter anymore about who is 
              doing Agile and who is not. It is about 
              who has become Agile best.</b> It is those 
              companies that truly get the heart of Agile, 
              implement the cultural shifts in becoming 
              Agile. They will eventually excel in their 
              products so much that they will outperform 
              their competitors every time, with respect 
              to innovation, quality and time to market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Agile Sense understands that any cultural 
              shift is a huge thing and <b>NOT easy</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We move at the pace that the adoption allows 
              and will not force the client into anything. 
              We focus on a holistic adoption in business 
              and IT. We start small and incrementally grow 
              the adoption just like one would build any 
              successful product.
